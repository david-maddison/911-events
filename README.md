## UX



### Colour Scheme 

The below color scheme was chosen to keep a traditional, efficient & clean pallette.
White, grey and black are colours traditionally seen in use by Porsche for branding. These will appeal to users of the website.
Green was used to create a call to action for the user in relation to joining and submitting the join-us form.
The following hex colors are used on the site:
- ![#3A3A3A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3A3A3A/000000?text=+) #3A3A3A
- ![#141414](https://via.placeholder.com/15/141414/000000?text=+) #141414 
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) #ffffff 
- ![#889599](https://via.placeholder.com/15/889599/000000?text=+) #889599
- ![#4CAF50](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4CAF50/000000?text=+) #4CAF50 
- ![#CCCCCC](https://via.placeholder.com/15/CCCCCC/000000?text=+) #CCCCCC

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Add scrren shots of Google Chrome, Firefox iPad, Edge and in mobile view.

### Responsiveness

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
