![Responsive Mockup](https://github.com/david-maddison/911-events/blob/main/docs/readme/responsive.png?raw=true)

## UX

- What is the idea?
  - The website is called 911 Events.
  - It is a website designed to cater for Porsche 911 enthusiasts and owners.
  - It will list events planned in the UK for 911 enthusiasts and owners.
  - It should provide links to all the latest news articles on 911 models.

- User Stories
  - As a new user the sites purpose should be immediately clear.
  - As a user I should be able to easily contact the site.
  - As a user I want to be able to follow the site on their social media platforms.
  - As a user I want to be able to sign up to a mailing list, to be kept up to date with new events and features.
  - As a user I want to have access to the latest Porsche 911 news.

### Colour Scheme 

The below color scheme was chosen to keep a traditional, efficient & clean pallette.
White, grey and black are colours traditionally seen in use by Porsche for branding. These will appeal to users of the website.
Green was used to create a call to action for the user in relation to joining and submitting the join-us form.
The following hex colors are used on the site:
- ![#3A3A3A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3A3A3A/000000?text=+) #3A3A3A
- ![#141414](https://via.placeholder.com/15/141414/000000?text=+) #141414 
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) #ffffff 
- ![#889599](https://via.placeholder.com/15/889599/000000?text=+) #889599
- ![#4CAF50](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4CAF50/000000?text=+) #4CAF50 
- ![#CCCCCC](https://via.placeholder.com/15/CCCCCC/000000?text=+) #CCCCCC
- ![#999999](https://via.placeholder.com/15/999999/000000?text=+) #999999

### Typography

- The fonts were chosen for their clean, simple look, to allow for the user to read with ease.
- The main font used throughout the site is **Roboto**.
- There are then two back up fonts used in the body and across the h1 & h2 elements.
  - The body uses a backup of **Open Sans Condensed**.
  - The h1 & h2 elements use a backup of **San-serif**.

### Wireframes

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all pages, the responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home, About, News, Events, Join Us and Contact pages. The Navigation Bar is identical on all pages to allow for easy navigation by its users.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

![Nav Bar](https://github.com/david-maddison/911-events/blob/main/docs/readme/navbar.png?raw=true)

- __The Home Page Image__

  - The main page uses an image of three classic Porsche 911's at a meetup (the hero image). This gives the user a clear indication of the intent of the website, and provides a strong colourful image for the main page.  
  - This section also includes a quote from Ferdinand Alexander Porsche. This is a well known quote from a member of the Porsche family, which users will instantly recognise. 

![Landing Page](https://github.com/david-maddison/911-events/blob/main/assets/images/hero.png?raw=true)

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for 911 Events. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

![Footer](https://github.com/david-maddison/911-events/blob/main/docs/readme/footer.png?raw=true)

- __Join Us Page__

  - This page will allow the user to get signed up to 911 Events to engage and take part in upcoming events. 
  - The user will be able to confirm if they are an owner or enthusiast. This will allow 911 Events to gauge how many 911 owners are on the mailing list. 
  - The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.
  - The form uses"required" attributes on each of the "select" & "input" elements. This ensures that the User completes each section of the form correctly, before they are able to finally submit.

### Features Left to Implement

- Members section
  - Currently I do not have the skills to attach a database to run a members section along with additional pages.
  - This will be required in the future to improve the user experience and to build on the creation of a community.
  - Users will be able to share images of their vehicles or events
  - A forum would also be useful to allow users to share information.

- Policies in the footer
  - Privacy policy
  - Terms of Use
  - Cookies
  - There was not enough time or resource to allow for the creation of these additional pages.

- Social Media Accounts
  - Accounts still need to be setup for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter & YouTube for 911 Events.
  - The icons in the footer can then be redirected to the 911 Events social media account for each icon, where as currently the icons take you to the social media platforms website.

### Responsiveness

The website has been designed as a desktop website, and then responsive media queries have been used to allow for the industry standard breakpoints.
[W3 Schools Media Queries](https://github.com/david-maddison/911-events/blob/main/docs/readme/mediaqueries.png?raw=true) were used to create breakpoints to allow for different screen sizes across large computers screens, laptops, tablets and mobiles.

### Acknowledgements

- A big thank you to Tim Nelson (my Code Institute Mentor) for his support and feedback during this first portfolio project. He has really helped me to apply what i've learned over the HTML and CSS modules. I certainly could not have imagined being able to do this before starting the course in August 2021.

- A huge thank you to my good friend David Hopkinson, who has helped me get to grips with Developer Tools in Chrome. Its amazing how things start to slot into place once you have been walked through a system like this and applied it to your own project.
